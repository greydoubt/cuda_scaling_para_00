* All your work should be within the `main` function
* Store the number of GPUs available in a variable for later use
* Using the number of entries and the number of GPUs, define a chunk size for each GPU's work. Remember to use the round-up division helper function `sdiv` for the reasons discussed in a previous section
* Create an array that contains pointers for the memory that will be allocated on each GPU
* Allocate a chunk's worth of data for each GPU
* Copy the correct chunk of data to each GPU
* For each GPU, decrypt its chunk of data
* Copy each GPU's chunk of data back to the host
* `make clean` will delete all binaries and report files, if needed
* You can edit the [*Makefile*](mgpu_cipher/Makefile) as you wish, for example, to change the name of generated binaries or report files. You can of course also enter the commands found in the *Makefile* directly into the terminal
